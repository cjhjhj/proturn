Pulse-SILAC has been used to analyze protein turnover in a system-wise. This package 
provides convenient functions to fit protein degradation and synthesis curves
using pulsed SILAC data. In addition, a graphical user interface is provided.

Install the package:
```r
library(devtools)
install_github("mengchen18/proturn")
```
