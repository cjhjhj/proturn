# Abstract

Pulse-SILAC has been used to analyze protein turnover from a system wise. 
This package provides convenient functions to fit protein degradation and synthesis curves
using pulsed SILAC data.
In addition, a graphical user interface is provided for biologists.

# General settings

# Parameter setting

# Result panel

## Synthesis curve

## Degradation curve

## Synthesis and degradation together
